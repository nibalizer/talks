Hiera

Hiera is a major subsystem inside Puppet. It is used to do key-value lookups inside your puppet manifests. While this sounds simple, using Hiera is often a challenge for new Puppeteers.

In this talk, we'll:

* Introduce what Hiera is
* Show some basic examples
* Show a single intermediate example
* Talk about some trouble points for new users
* Talk about how PuppetDB and Hiera are different
* Leave ample time for questions
