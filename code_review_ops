Title: Code Review for Operations

Code review has been shown to help developers produce better code. It can also help SREs run more reliable systems. Our ops team is fanatic about using code review and representing our infrastructure as code so that code review can be leveraged. In this presentation I will show how we use code review to manage our infrastructure, modify and create systems, administer services, etc. I'll show the path we took to get here, what actions couldn't be piped through code review, and what we're going to next.

Outline(usually unpublished):
