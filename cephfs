CephFS as a replacement for NFS

For years NFS has been the cheap and simple way to attach remote
storage in multiple places. Unlike many block level solutions, NFS
allows multiple machines to connect to the filesystem simultaneously.
The problem with NFS has always been its central NFS server, which
represents a single point of failure.

In this talk, we will analyze CephFS as a possible replacement
for the many tasks NFS is doing now. CephFS an experimental
filesystem driver for Linux that provides NFS-like log-ins to
remote storage pools. Ceph is an OpenStack related technology
that provides distributed storage and redundancy. 

In this talk we will present results of testing and performance benchmarking
on both NFS systems and CephFS systems, as well as presenting some early 
conclusions from that data. We will look at the race conditions
experienced by files in clustered file system situations, and how
NFS and CephFS deal with that. And we will evaluate the benefits and
costs of a significant CephFS distributed filesystem installation.
