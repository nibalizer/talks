In 1995, 20 years ago, the Apache web server became the most widely used web server and played a key role in the early growth of the web. The success of Linux is also well documented. In recent times however, which Open Source technologies had major impacts on IT? What Open Source tools do IT professionals use and depend on every day? What areas are still better covered by proprietary software? What are the unsung foss heros of every sysadmin's toolbelt? Is the IT landscape heading more towards foss or proprietary technology? I'll answer these questions and explain my vision for the future, including how foss can make changes today to affect the IT landscape of tomorrow.
