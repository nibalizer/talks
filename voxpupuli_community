In the last two years, I have been a part of the VoxPupuli(https://voxpupuli.org/) project. This is a 'little project that could' that started extremely small and now has dozens of consistent contributors, over a hundred git repositories, a logo, a governance system, and elected officials.

What this project represents to me, is my first step into a leadership role. I've been a user, contributor, and core of Open Source/Free Software projects before, but this is my first time dealing with the leadership aspect. I'm relatively new to the 'movement' part of all this, and as a newcomer I had to 'relearn' what was already learned by leaders that came before me.

I'll discuss our origin, and detail the issues we've faced as a project. I'll talk about the actions myself and the other leaders took, what worked, what didn't, and what I've learned. The exact technology inside VoxPupuli will be brought up in passing, but mostly this is about building a community and the challenges a community faces today.
