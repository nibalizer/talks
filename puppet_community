Ready. Set. Community.

Puppet is an Open Source software suite for configuring servers. It is maintained primarily by the company "Puppet Labs." Most users of the Puppet software use or write modules in the Puppet language. These small pieces of code did not have their own open source community, so we made one. This is the story of the creation of the 'puppet-community' effort. We have 80+ repositories and 40+ core contributors, with dozens of other contributors. We come from many countries and many companies. We write, merge, and release code at an astounding rate.

We'll discuss 
  * Formation of this group

  * Communication
  * Automated Tooling
  * What we've done that works, what doesn't
