On the OpenStack Infrastructure team, we fire our Puppet runs from Ansible. We split the responsibilities of these tools: Puppet performs configuration management, Ansible performs orchestration. In this talk, we'll talk about what prompted us to create this system, what we've been able to do with it, and where we are going next. We'll describe the setup of our systems and network. We'll also show you some things that we tried that didn't work, so that you don't have to make the same mistake. Everything you see in this talk is 100% Open Source and running live on the OpenStack Infrastructure servers. We've developed some high level patterns that you can take back to your sites to start using immediately.


What you will learn:

What (in our opinion) Puppet and Ansible each do best.
How to compose configuration management tools.
How to develop, store, and run your config mgmt code in the open.
How to consume other Open Source Ansible playbooks and Puppet modules.
