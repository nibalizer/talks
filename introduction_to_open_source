What is OpenSource

In this talk, I'll explain what OpenSource means(to me). I'll talk about the old Open Source and the new Open Source. I'll talk about the conflict between them, and the challenges faced by the Open Source community as it reinvents itself. I'll talk about new forms of organization in Open Source, and the conflicts of interest that business and VC are creating for developers. I'll talk about OpenSource risks and challenges, and the risks a project undertakes when a corporation gets involved.
