I have an extensive speaking background. I have done semi-professional technical trainings, and have spoken many conferences, including FOSDEM, OSCON, FOSSETCON, and SCaLE. I have never actually been able to come to LFNW, but this year is my time! I have the dates hard-booked in my calendar and the usual conflict with the OpenStack Design Summit isn't a problem this time.
