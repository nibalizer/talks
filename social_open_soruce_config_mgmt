In the 100% open source OpenStack Infra team, there is a feedback loop between the social elements and the technical elements being worked on. New contributors come in and old contributors move on. The cost of upgrading software creates technical debt, while the new hotness technologies bustle trying to get play. In this talk we'll discuss these factors, how they play against each other, and how the project has navigated these waters. We'll talk about what we've done well, where we've made mistakes, and what the future looks like (we think!)
