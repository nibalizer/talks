It is sometimes said or thought, maybe subconsciously communicated, that some modules are better than others because one is more complex than another. While I do agree that there are 'bad' modules who are poorly coded. I propose that we think about modules along a spectrum. Some modules are made to be quick to write, fast to deploy, and hard to pivot. We can evaluate the merit of that module against a new metric, and we may find it quite good. In this talk I will present my ideas of where the major stops are along a 'spectrum' of modules with examples of each.
