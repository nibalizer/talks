Deploying Applications on Openstack With Puppet

Puppet is a configuration managment system. It can be used to
configure machines and deploy applications. In this talk, we'll
discuss best practices for using Puppet on an OpenStack cloud.

A brief list of questions that will be answered:

  * Where does the Puppet Master go?
  * Does Puppet hit the openstack api?
  * What kind of cert names should be used in the cloud?
  * Do we use Puppet for orchestration?
  * How do we autoscale?
  * How do we monitor the health of the application?
