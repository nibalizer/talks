Iin this crisp talk, I'll explain what makes a good alert. I'll talk about several factors to consider when crafting an alert, such as actionability. I'll give some examples of great alerts and not so great alerts. Audience members can take this information back to their systems and improve or remove bad alerts, and they can create only good alerts going forward.
