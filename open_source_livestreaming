In this talk, I'll present an overview of the open source tools and libraries used and useful in the live streaming space. Key among these is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS, https://obsproject.com/) but there are a lot more open source components out there. I'll provide brief introductions to them, demonstrate some use, talk about compatibility and extension points. I'll have a mixture of software relevant to streamers, to content consumers and end users, and to platform and game creators. At the end of this presentation, developers will be itching to get out their laptops and start hacking.
